The key component in every PINN when solving these problems is the boundary conditions, which constrain the underlying boundary value problem \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02548}{(arXiv)}.
	
	The application of PINNs in solving boundary layer problems could lead to more efficient and cost-effective solutions in aerospace, automotive, and HVAC systems, aligning well with the goal of making high-end technologies more affordable and impactful.
	
	
	\subsection{Real-time HVAC Systems}
	Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in real-time HVAC systems could be groundbreaking. Imagine a smart HVAC system that not only adjusts the temperature but also understands the thermal dynamics of the entire building. It could predict how different rooms will heat up or cool down throughout the day and adjust the HVAC settings accordingly. This would not only make the system more efficient but also reduce energy consumption, thereby making it more cost-effective. Such a system could be particularly useful in large commercial buildings, hospitals, or even in smart cities, aligning well with the goal of making high-end technologies more affordable and impactful.
	
	Recent research indicates that solving real-time control problems in HVAC systems may still be intractable even when solving is possible in real-time \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-36799-6}{(Nature)}. However, PINNs leverage deep learning methods to provide an alternative approach to real-time modeling, offering a promising avenue for future developments \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-43325-1}{(Nature)}.
